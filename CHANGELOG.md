## v3.0.0 / 2014 Aug 28

> This is a **major update** that **may be BREAKING** for users upgrading from < `v2.1.0-RC1`.
> It introduces ClojureScript translation support and fixes a number of useability sharp edges.

 * **FIX**: All localization formatters are now correctly thread safe.

 * **NEW**: Added ClojureScript translation support. See the README for an example and notes.
 * **NEW**: `timezones` fn now supports optional timezone-ids arg.
 * **NEW**: Add `all-timezone-ids` set.
 * **NEW** [#42]: Translation dictionary now supports underscores in translation keys.
 * **NEW** [#43]: Translation fns can now take a _vector_ of descending-preference locales (@vvvvalvalval).
 * **NEW** [#43]: Ring middleware now automatically attaches a smarter translation fn that'll search through all of a client's sorted Accept-Language header languages when looking for a translation.
 * **NEW** [#50], [#52]: Translation dictionary now supports arbitrary (non-JVM) locales.

 * **CHANGE**: Dropped (experimental) `:scope-var` tconfig option.
 * **CHANGE**: Dropped (experimental) `:root-scope` tconfig option.
 * **CHANGE**: Default :missing translations entry now avoids <>'s (no need for html escaping).
 * **CHANGE**: `languages` now returns languages as "localized (unlocalized)" pairs rather than "unlocalized (localized)" pairs.
 * **CHANGE**: All `Exception`s are now `ExceptionInfo`s.

 * **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: `translate` and `t` are both being phased out in favor of a new `make-t` fn. The new approach is more flexible and faster. This change is _non-breaking_ **if** you use the Ring middleware; otherwise please see the README for new recommended usage examples.

 * **DEPRECATED**: `locale`->`jvm-locale`, `try-locale`->`try-jvm-locale` (only the names have changed).
 * **DEPRECATED**: `wrap-tower-middleware` -> `wrap-tower`. This is a recommended change, but it's **BREAKING** if you make it:
  ```clojure
  ;;; 1. The fn signature has changed (tconfig is now an explicit arg):
  (wrap-tower-middleware <ring-handler> {:tconfig _ <other opts>}) ; Old
  ;; vs
  (wrap-tower <ring-handler> <tconfig> {<other-opts>}) ; New

  ;;; 2. The Ring request's `:t` key has changed:
  {:locale _ :t  (fn [k-or-ks & fmt-args])} ; Old
  ;; vs
  {:locale _ :t  (fn [locale k-or-ks & fmt-args]) ; Now takes a locale
             :t' (fn [k-or-ks & fmt-args])}       ; New, behaves like old `:t`
  ```

 The new behaviour is more consistent. `t` always refers to a translation fn that takes a locale arg, and `t'` always refer to a partial translation fn that has already been provided a locale arg. **Migrate** by swapping your middleware, and using `t'` instead of `t` as your locale-less translation fn. **OR** you can give a `:legacy-t? true` opt to `wrap-tower` to keep the old behaviour.


## v2.0.2 / 2014 Jan 19

> This is a **backwards compatible bug fix release**. Recommended upgrade.

### New

 * `normalize` fn now takes optional normalization form.

### Fixes

 * Broken `fmt-fn` argument for translate fn.
 * Fallback locales should have `locale-key` called on their locale.
 * #37 Broken `t` parent fallback for empty child locales.


## v2.0.0 → v2.0.1

  Minor, non-breaking release: **2013 Nov 26**.

  * [FIX] Translations: `with-tscope` was preventing `:missing` translation fallbacks from working correctly (ystael).
  * [HK] Translations: `t` now throws a proper error message when trying to format arguments against a `nil` translation pattern.


## v2.0.0-beta3 → 2.0.0

  * **BREAKING**: extra args to `t` now get formatted with `java.util.Formatter` (`fmt-str`) rather than `MessageFormat` (`fmt-msg`). You can override this preference by specifying a `:fmt-fn` config option. `oldt` retains the old behavior by default.
  * **BREAKING**: `languages` and `countries` now return lowercase keyword codes.
  * **BREAKING**: `languages`, `countries`, and `timezones` now return sorted maps.
  * Dictionaries: can now load locales from additional resource files (mopemope).
  * Dictionaries: refactored.
  * New public vars: `iso-countries`, `iso-languages`, `major-timezone-ids`.


## v1.7.1 → 2.0.0-beta3

So there's good news and bad news. The bad news is Tower v2's API is almost **completely different to the v1 API**.

The good news is the new API is (with the exception of `t`) **entirely self-contained**. Meaning: v2 **contains** the (now deprecated) v1 API and it should be possible to use v2 as an (almost) drop-in replacement for v1 while you migrate at your convenience.

**If you just want v2 to "work" without migrating**: rename your `t` calls to `oldt`.

**If you want to migrate**:

  * **BREAKING**: `t` now takes an explicit locale and a config map of the same form as the v1 `config` atom.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `parse-Locale` -> `locale`. Only the name has changed.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `with-scope` -> `with-tscope`. Only the name has changed.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `format-str` -> `fmt-str`, `format-msg` -> `fmt-msg`. The new fns take an explicit locale arg.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `l-compare` -> `lcomparator`. The new fn takes an explicit locale arg and returns a comparator fn.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `format-*` -> `fmt`, `parse-*` -> `parse`. So these 2 fns now handles the job of ~14 fns from the old API. See the appropriate docstring for details.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `sorted-localized-countries` -> `countries`, `sorted-localized-languages` -> `languages`, `sorted-timezones` -> `timezones`. The new fns take an explicit locale arg and provide their result as a vector rather than a map.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `config`, `set-config!`, `merge-config!`, `load-dictionary-from-map-resource!` have all been dropped. Instead, `t` now takes an explicit `config` argument of the same form as the old `config` atom. The `:dictionary` value may now be a resource name like "tower-dictionary.clj". When `:dictionary` is a resource name and `:dev-mode?` is true, the resource will be watched for changes.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `ring/wrap-i18n-middleware` -> `ring/wrap-tower-middleware`. Args have changed and a number of new features have been added. See the docstring for details.
  * Added `:scope-var` option to `t`'s config map. Useful for lib authors and other advanced users (defaults to `#'taoensso.tower/*tscope*`).
  * Added `_md`/`*` translation decorators for block-style rather than inline (default) Markdown.

So, basically, idiomatic Tower usage has been simplified:

  * The `fmt` and `parse` fns have replaced most individual localization fns.
  * All API fns now take an explicit locale argument.
  * The Ring middleware provides a `*locale*` thread-local binding and a `:locale` request key to help with the above (use whichever is more convenient).
  * The `t` fn now takes an explicit config map rather than depending on a global config atom.
  * The Ring middleware provides a `:t (partial tower/t locale config)` key to help with the above.


## v1.6.0 → v1.7.1

  * `load-dictionary-from-map-resource!` now supports optionally overwriting (vs merging) with new optional `merge?` arg.
  * **BREAKING**: Drop Clojure 1.3 support.


## v1.5.1 → v1.6.0

  * A number of bug fixes.
  * Added support for translation aliases. If a dictionary entry's value is a keyword, it will now function as a pointer to another entry's value. See the default dictionary for an example.
